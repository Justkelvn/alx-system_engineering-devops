In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

But my answer file would contain:

sylvain@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sylvain@ubuntu
As you can tell, I am not using emacs to perform the task in my answer file. This exercise is aiming at training you on automating your work. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an SRE, that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. Note that the checker will execute your script as the root user, you do not need to use the sudo command.

A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer. 

Tips: to test your answer Bash script, feel free to reproduce the checker environment:

start a Ubuntu 16.04 sandbox
run your script on it
see how it behaves

Readme:

-y on apt-get command
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx
Server terminal:

root@sy-web-01$ ./1-install_nginx_web_server > /dev/null 2>&1
root@sy-web-01$ 
root@sy-web-01$ curl localhost
Hello World!
root@sy-web-01$ 
Local terminal:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl 34.198.248.145/
Hello World!
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:43:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 30

Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "58abea7c-1e"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

sylvain@ubuntu$
In this example 34.198.248.145 is the IP of my web-01 server. If you want to query the Nginx that is locally installed on your server, you can use curl 127.0.0.1.

If things are not going as expected, make sure to check out Nginx logs, they can be found in /var/log/.
